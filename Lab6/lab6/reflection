This laboratory assignment was different from the previous assignments. I did not find it all that difficult to find the bugs within the program, but fixing the bugs was a more difficult process.I struggled with a few aspects of the assignment, such as the decimal formatting and correct variable declarations. I was able to overcome these difficulties by using the text book and previous assignments as references. Overall I enjoyed this Lab assignment a little more than the previous ones, partly because I feel like I am starting to make progress in the course.
